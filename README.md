# Real-time Messaging System

A modern real-time messaging system built with Node.js, Socket.io, Redis, and TypeScript.

## System Architecture Overview

This real-time messaging system is built using modern technologies:
- Node.js for server logic
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- Redis for caching
- TypeScript for type safety
- MySQL for primary data storage

### Core Components

1. Single backend server handling both WebSocket connections and HTTP requests
2. Primary database for message storage (MySQL)
3. Redis for handling real-time features and caching

## Implementation Details

### Real-Time Communication

The system utilizes Socket.io and Node.js for real-time communication. The workflow is as follows:

1. Socket.io client initiates connection with authentication token
2. Redis validates and manages session information
3. Users join chat channels through Socket.io "join" events
4. Node.js server coordinates with Redis for channel management
5. Real-time messaging is handled through Socket.io while Node.js manages database and Redis state updates

### Scalability Approach

The system implements a straightforward scaling strategy:
- Horizontal scaling of the server when needed
- Redis for managing WebSocket sessions
- Database indexing for faster queries

### Error Handling

The system implements basic error handling for:
- Connection drops
- Message delivery failures
- Database transaction failures

### Future Considerations

Planned improvements include:
- Message search functionality
- File sharing capabilities (images)
- Message reactions

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm run start
```

## Technology Stack
